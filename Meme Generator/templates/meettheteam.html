		<p> Hi! My name is Malcolm Flaherty. I am a CSCI Graduate student working on completing my first year on the Masters program. After graduating, I plan to pursue a career in video game design/development. I am originally from a small town called Winthrop near Boston, MA, I moved to NC when I was about 11 years old and have lived here ever since.</p>
		<p>I created this application to give people an easy way to create their meme ideas and be able to share them quickly with others. I hope that this application creates more opporunities for creative expression and comedic prosperity!</p>
